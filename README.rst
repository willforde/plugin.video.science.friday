Science Friday
==============
.. image:: resources/icon.png

This is a kodi video add-on for Science Friday science videos.

Science Friday is your trusted source for news and entertaining stories about science.
Started as a radio show, created in 1991 by host and executive producer Ira Flatow. Since then,
weve grown into much more: We produce award-winning digital videos and publish original web content
covering everything from octopus camouflage to cooking on Mars. SciFri is brain fun, for curious people.

The add-on is available in the official kodi repository for kodi v17 "Krypton" and greater.
